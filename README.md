# Spoileuler
Conte91's Haskell learning sandbox -- by solving Euler Project's problems

I'm trying to learn Haskell, I'd like to test myself with Euler's Project. This repo is is the natural solution to both the problems :)

Checkout solutions by problem's number -> Makefile -> Executable

## How to checkout solutions ##
Nobody wants to spoiler the solutions to these problems, so the source code for each problem is encrypted using GnuPG. 

Passphrase for the files is 'no spoiler'.

_As the passphrase implies, don't spoil yourself with solutions to problems you didn't solve.. Otherwise, where's the fun?_ :)

## How to build ##
Simply use the top-level Makefile. 

Targets:
  make n: builds one problem by number
  make: builds all the problems -- you will have to enter the passphrase maaaany times!

  make n_encrypt: reencrypt one source file, useful if you want to propose patches!
  make encrypt: reencrypt everything
